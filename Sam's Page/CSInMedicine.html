                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first conceived in
                            the 1950 by Alan Turning in his book Computers and
                            intelligence. He created what we know as the turing
                            test, a way of figuring out if computers are capable
                            of human intelligence.

                            Now in the modern world we know AI to be very
                            powerful such as tools like chat gpt becoming an
                            almost search engine with a brain to Machine
                            learning that can help us predict ‘unknown’ outcomes
                            like human behaviour.

                            Like with most technologies medicine has been riding
                            the cutting edge with AI and ever since the early
                            days of AI has been trying to work with it and adopt
                            it into its sector.

                            The first AI were focused on making decisions and
                            abilities humans could already make, such as robotic
                            arms or chatterbots.
                            In this early period a important job was done,
                            digitising data set the foundation of future
                            utilisation within medicine and the creation of a
                            web-based search engine built around medicine.
                            This led to a later acceleration of biomedicine due
                            to this large amount of data being easily accessible
                            for not only humans but the artificial intelligence

                                During this time we come across what is known as the first ‘AI winter’. This is when AI projects had investment defunded and the interest in it dropped.
        This was due to a number of factors but one of the most important is the limited computer power available.
        However it is worth noting there were some advancements made within this time period:
        In 1973 a time shared computer system was created which enhanced communication for biomedical institutions that meant that advancements and information could be done efficiently.
        One of the first consultation programs was made during this time using the CASNET model. This model could apply information about a specific disease and provide doctors information on how they could treat them.
        To build on from this another system was built in 1986 called DXplain, another decision support system conceived by the University of Massachusetts. This program could take information about specific diseases and apply them to around 500 diseases and then up to 2400. When we hit the 1990s we found interest in Machine learning was renewed and the medical world set the stage for modern ML.

                        Although some may say that the overall progression of technology into the future is a bad thing, the asset that computer science has provided to the medical industry cannot go unnoticed. We have seen advancements  in diagnosis technology being able to locate rare diseases patients may have saving lives quickly.
This goes hand in hand with AI ability to personalise treatment for patients. This has meant that we can optimise the lifespan of the human race and in turn improve our living conditions. 
As we look to the future we may find that AI becomes a tool as common as the calculator and with this change we may find health sectors becoming a higher standard for us.

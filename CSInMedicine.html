            <div class="box">
                <p>The idea Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first conceived in the 1950 by Alan Turning in his book Computers and intelligence. He created what we know as the turing test, a way of figuring out if computers are capable of human intelligence.
                    Now in the modern world we know AI to be very powerful such as tools like chat gpt becoming an almost search engine with a brain to Machine learning that can help us predict ‘unknown’ outcomes like human behaviour.
                    Like with most technologies medicine has been riding the cutting edge with AI and ever since the early days of AI has been trying to work with it and adopt it into its sector.

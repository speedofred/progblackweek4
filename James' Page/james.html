                    <p>⚪Internet Access</p>
                    <p>Computers are the primary means of internet access. Internet access has allowed the sharing of knowledge on top of vast repositories of infomation and resources such as courses, journals and libraries.</p>
                    <p>⚪Online Courses</p>
                    <p>Ability to gain qualifications and knowledge, usually obtained within a physical place of education such as a school, now obtainable from your home. </p>
                    <p>⚪E-books and E-readers</p>
                    <p>Physical, and perhaps expensive or exclusive, books can now be accessed using the internet and there is less need for carrying many books when several can be accessed by even small computers such as phones. Devices such as phone also allow for the same portability of education and infomation that a book would hold.</p>

                    <p>⚪Accessability</p>
                    <p>Computers allow for online education. It allows for anyone, provided they have a computer, to join online classes, read online class notes and much more. It breaks down the disadvantages of regular classes such as physical precense, and it allows for students from all over the world can access materials and courses anyone could.</p>
                    <p>⚪Convenience and Pacing</p>

                    <p>⚪Enhanced Creativity</p>
                    <p>Computers provide creation software, wether thats IDEs for programming, photoshop for images or other art softwares, it provides users with the means to enhance their skills and education by giving them ranges of tools to complete a task exactly how they would want to.</p>
                    <p>⚪Enhanced Education Tools</p>
                    <p>Durham's blackboard ultra and other tools such as gradescope, allow for majorities of education to be digitalised. This is important as lecturers have hundereds of students, hence it is more practical and useful to be able to communicate online, where students view questions and submit answers with the use of computers.</p>
                    <p>⚪Collaboration</p>
                    <p>Tools such as Github allow several users to work as a team when it comes to educational projects. This is because computers allow digital work to be sent and shared to servers, hence user's can view and edit other group members work online rather than meeting up in person, hence computers allow for further practicallity on top of the sharing of important infomation and education through software and application.</p>

                            the use of virtual and augmented reality; from

                            In summary the hospital now uses VR to aid with
                            "neurosurgery" and "thoracic surgery". The
                            technology enables the visualisation of the
                            patient's
                            body without making an incision. The idea
                            originates from
                            "flight simulators designed to train fighter pilots"
                            which was then adapted to
                            allow for the mapping of the human body. After
                            planning, the surgeon can easiy demonstrate to
                            their patient how they plan to remove their
                            tumor
                            (or perform their surgery, for example) by
                            handing over the headset and explaining their
                            plan
                            in a 3D environment. Traditional scans from
                            CT and MRI machines can be processed and
                            simulated
                            within the environment, making it super easy
                            for medical professionals to accurately simulate
                            the
                            required area of the body. 3D models can be
                            exported to presentations using advanced
                            software,
                            enabling surgeons to share simulations
                            between their colleagues.

                                transformation of medical education
                                @FutureHealth</a> -

                            Virtual reality for training purposes is a great
                            way to create a safe environment for learning
                            complex, or even simple, procedures. It is
                            relatively in-expensive to set up and each
                            simulation is reproducable. In other words, a
                            teacher can create a scenario which can repeated
                            by
                            any student any number of times which is
                            guarenteed
                            to follow the same rules/protocols. This allows
                            for
                            specific procedures to be practiced, or entire
                            surgeries to be trialed again and again before
                            letting the student go and cut someone open.
                            Additionally, performance metrics can be
                            gathered
                            for each student and can be compiled in an
                            automated
                            report. This streamlines the education process
                            as
                            educators no longer have to be there in-person
                            to
                            assess mistakes and provide feedback. VR set-ups
                            take up relatively little lab space, allowing
                            multiple students in the same environment to
                            simultaneously attempt a procedure virtually.
